## 🧭 Methods & Workflow



### 1. 📊 Data Collection & Preparation

- Compiled 300+ ISRO mission records from public databases and media sources  

- Features include: `launch_vehicle`, `payload_mass`, `mission_type`, `launch_cost`, `weather`, and `outcome`

- Cleaned and standardized data using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **feature engineering** pipelines



### 2. 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized distributions and correlations using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**

- Built **correlation heatmaps**, **time-series trends**, and **geospatial maps (Folium)**  

- Identified key cost drivers and payload patterns over time



### 3. 🤖 Statistical & Machine Learning Modeling

Implemented end-to-end ML workflow using **scikit-learn** and **XGBoost**:

- **Regression** → Forecast launch expenses  

- **Classification** → Predict mission success  

- **Clustering (K-Means)** → Segment launches by cost and mission profile  

- **Explainability** → Feature importance analysis to interpret key factors



### 4. 🗺️ Interactive Visualization & Decision Support

Developed a full-featured **Streamlit Dashboard** with:

- Dynamic filters, search, and visualization panels  

- **Plotly** charts, **Folium** maps, and **scenario simulation tools**  

- Batch prediction interface and feature importance graphs  

- Custom **dark-themed UI** for professional presentation



### 5. 🧩 Repository Structure & Version Control

Organized with clarity and modularity:



Version-controlled via **Git & GitHub**, following best practices with `.gitignore` and detailed documentation.
