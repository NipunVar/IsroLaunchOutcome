## 🧭 Methods & Workflow

### 1. 📊 Data Collection & Preparation
- Compiled 300+ ISRO mission records from public databases and media sources  
- Features include: `launch_vehicle`, `payload_mass`, `mission_type`, `launch_cost`, `weather`, and `outcome`
- Cleaned and standardized data using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **feature engineering** pipelines

### 2. 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized distributions and correlations using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**
- Built **correlation heatmaps**, **time-series trends**, and **geospatial maps (Folium)**  
- Identified key cost drivers and payload patterns over time

### 3. 🤖 Statistical & Machine Learning Modeling
Implemented end-to-end ML workflow using **scikit-learn** and **XGBoost**:
- **Regression** → Forecast launch expenses  
- **Classification** → Predict mission success  
- **Clustering (K-Means)** → Segment launches by cost and mission profile  
- **Explainability** → Feature importance analysis to interpret key factors

### 4. 🗺️ Interactive Visualization & Decision Support
Developed a full-featured **Streamlit Dashboard** with:
- Dynamic filters, search, and visualization panels  
- **Plotly** charts, **Folium** maps, and **scenario simulation tools**  
- Batch prediction interface and feature importance graphs  
- Custom **dark-themed UI** for professional presentation

### 5. 🧩 Repository Structure & Version Control
Organized with clarity and modularity:

Version-controlled via **Git & GitHub**, following best practices with `.gitignore` and detailed documentation.
