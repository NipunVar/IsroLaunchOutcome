ISRO Mission Dashboard
This dashboard helps you explore ISRO's (Indian Space Research Organisation) fascinating space missions! It provides a clear, visual breakdown of key mission parameters, helping you understand India's journey into space.

Features
Interactive Data Visualization: Explore missions through dynamic charts and graphs.

Mission Clusters: Identify trends and typical mission profiles based on payload mass and cost.

Comprehensive Glossary: Understand key terms like Launch Vehicles, Orbits, and Mission Costs directly within the app.

Key Terms and Definitions
This section provides a quick reference for the terms used in the dashboard.

Launch Vehicles: PSLV and GSLV
PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle): ISRO's reliable workhorse, primarily used for launching satellites into Polar Orbits.

GSLV (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle): ISRO's heavier lifter, designed to launch larger communication and weather satellites into higher Geosynchronous Transfer Orbits.

Payload Type
The main purpose or function of a satellite or spacecraft. Examples include Communication, Earth Observation, Navigation, and Scientific.

Payload Mass (kg)
The total weight of the rocket's payload, measured in kilograms (kg).

Mission Cost (INR Cr)
The total expense of a mission in Indian Rupees Crores (INR Cr). One Crore is equal to 10 million.

Launch Site
The physical location from where the rocket takes off. ISRO's primary sites are at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR on Sriharikota Island.

Orbit Type
The specific path a satellite follows around Earth. Examples include GTO, SSO, LEO, and Lunar Transfer Orbit.

Launch Outcome
Indicates whether the mission was successful or not. Categories include Success, Partial Failure, and Failure.

Mission Clusters
Groups of missions identified based on similarities in their Payload Mass and Mission Cost, used to reveal trends in mission planning.

Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure of the dashboard.

CSS: For styling and layout.
